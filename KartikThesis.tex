\begin{abstract}Every scheduler available in the market comes with plethora of features and 
options for customizations that fulfills the goals of a custom built 
clusters and data centers but not all features are sufficient for running the 
data center at its peak. One such case is when filesystem crashes over large I/O 
overhead and we see performance of the cluster degrading when there is absence of balance in load
pertaining to either I/O, network, CPU or RAM usage.
These issues that we encounter in real life at Holland Computing Center are the 
basis for tackling these set of problems. The end result is the development of a Co-Scheduler for the
cluster that solves the problem of performance degradation that is caused when some of the resource 
is throttled to a greater extent for some kind of workloads.\end{abstract}

Although modern schedulers in clusters provide innumerable features, the basic 
problem existing with the scheduler hasn't been solved yet. The problem of 
performance degradation when many jobs are scheduled on single system either 
based on processor equivalence or based on number of processor slots. Some of 
these schedulers are smart enough to take into account contention of other 
resources like RAM but ultimately convert the 2D vector values of CPU and RAM 
into a single scalar value which equals to hardcoding the value or presenting these resources
in some kind of ratio.

\section{Co-Scheduler}

%% Thesis goes here\chapter{Background}HTCondor is a distributed system developed by HTCondor team at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison.It provides High-Throughput Computing environment to sites 
that foster research computing and enables sites to share computing resources when 
workstations are idle at a given site. HTCondor system includes a batch queuing 
system for a pool of workstations, HTCondor runs on both UNIX and windows based 
workstations that are all connected by a network. 

\section{High-Throughput Computing} The workloads that run on 
condor system doesn't have an objective of  how fast the job can be completed but how many 
times can the job be run in the next few months.To be precise, European Grid 
Infrastructure defines HTC as a computing paradigm that focuses on the efficient 
execution of large number of loosely coupled tasks.
\section{Open Science Grid} Open Science Grid(OSG), provides service and support 
for resource providers and scientific institutions using a distributed fabric of 
high throughout computational services. Initially OSG was created to facilitate data analysis from the 
Large Hadron Collider and about 70\% of the resources are used on analysis of data from particle colliders.
OSG doesn't own resources but provides software and services to users and enables opportunistic usage and  sharing of resources among
resource providers.The main goal of OSG is to advance science through open 
distributed computing. The OSG is multi-disciplinary partnership to federate 
local, regional, community and national cyber-infrastructures to meet the needs 
of research and academic communities at all scales.
