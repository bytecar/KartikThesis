	Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of available computing and storage resources, yet few have been able to exploit these resources in an aggregated form. We present the Condor-G system, which leverages software from Globus and Condor to allow users to harness multi-domain resources as if they all belong to one personal domain. We describe the structure of Condor-G and how it handles job management, resource selection, security and fault tolerance},
